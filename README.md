# feed-realtime-sailsjs

A simple feed realtime website with BlueprintAPI, Sails Socket.IO and Faker 😈

## Up & Running

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `sails lift`.
3. Go to `http://localhost:1337` to see the results.

*Note: You should open some browser windows to see the socket effect. The data will reset when you restart Sails server*

Happy learning 😁
